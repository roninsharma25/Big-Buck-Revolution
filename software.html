                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        We used the Model-View-Controller design pattern when structuring our code. This approach separated different 
                        aspects of the game, allowing us to use modularity. The models included game objects, so for our project the two 
                        models were arrows and buttons. Views display the models to the player, so we had draw methods for each of these models. 
                        In our project, we only had one view since we always drew models to the same screen and just varied the position.
                        The controllers updated the game state. We had a controller for each screen and each controller determined which models appeared 
                        on each screen, where they were drawn, and how the player could interact with them.

                        Here is the overall file system structure. In the following sections, we will explain this in more detail.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Models</h2>

                    <p>Our game had two models: Button and Arrow.</p>

                    <h4>Button Model</h4>

                    <p>
                        The button model was used to add interactive buttons to the game. On some screens, players have the option to navigate between different 
                        options, and each option is a button. For example, on the menu screen, players select the game type, so each game type is a button. In the class, 
                        for this model, there are attributes for the font, text, and text size. Additionally, when a player hovers over a button, it is highlighted. We have 
                        additional attributes that store whether the button is highlighted. The methods <i>setHighlighted</i> and <i>setSelected</i> updated these attributes.
                        ADD IMAGES SHOWING HIGHLIGHTED/NOT HIGHLIGHTED
                        In this class, we also had a draw method, which we will discuss in the Views section. Lastly, we had an <i>updateText</i> method that changed the text 
                        of a button. This method was only used on one screen, but we still included it as a method to follow our modular design principle.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Arrow Model</h4>

                    <p>
                        The arrow model was used to add stationary and moving arrows to the game. Each arrow had several attributes; we highlight the essential ones below.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Position - x and y coordinates of the arrow on the screen</li>
                            <li>Speed/Approach Rate - how fast the arrow moves down the screen</li>
                            <li>Direction - orientation of the arrow (left, right, up, down)</li>
                            <li>Note Time - absolute time when the arrow should be pressed</li>
                        </ul>

                        The arrow class had draw and update methods, which we will discuss in the Views and Controllers sections. It also had position getters to obtain the x 
                        and y positions of individual arrows. We included a delete method to remove the arrow from the screen. Lastly, we added a format method which returned 
                        relevant information about an arrow (note time, direction) in an easily parsable list format.
                    </p>

                    <p>Here is an example of an arrow.</p>

                    <h2>Controllers</h2>

                    <p>
                        We had seven controllers in our game.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Input Controller</li>
                            <li>Menu Controller</li>
                            <li>Select Controller</li>
                            <li>Difficulty Controller</li>
                            <li>Game Controller</li>
                            <li>Done Controller</li>
                            <li>Edit Controller</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Input Controller</h4>

                    <p>
                        The input controller handled detecting user inputs, which were mainly the pressure pad inputs. The class had attributes for all four 
                        directions (left, right, up, down). The type of each attribute was a boolean, so it was <i>True</i> when the input was pressed, and <i>False</i>
                        otherwise. We also implemented software-side debouncing. To do this, we had attributes that stored the current 
                        and previous value for each direction. For example, for the left arrow input, we had two attributes: <i>prev_left</i> and <i>curr_left</i>. We defined 
                        functions that checked if any input pad was pressed (4 total). These functions checked if the current attribute is <i>True</i> and the previous attribute 
                        is <i>False</i>. It both conditions were <i>True</i>, then the input was pressed. We had more functions that used similar logic to check if inputs 
                        were released. This class also contained a <i>lightButton</i> method which used a PWM signal to light up the LEDs on the side of the dance pad.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Menu Controller</h4>

                    <p>
                        The Menu Controller handled updating the main menu screen based on user inputs. It had three buttons, 'Single Player', 'Multiplayer', and 'Level Editor'. 
                        When the player selected one of those options, this controller updated its <i>exitCode</i> attribute. We used this same convention in all our controllers 
                        to transition between screens. The controller would set the attribute based on the button that was selected and then the top level script (<i>game.py</i> which we 
                        will discuss later) transitioned to the next screen based on the attribute's value.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Select Controller</h4>

                    <p>
                        The Select Controller handled the song selector screen. On this screen, all of the possible songs were displayed, and the user had to select one of them. This 
                        controller was very similar to the Menu Controller, as its main functionality was updating its <i>exitCode</i> attribute, so that the top level script could 
                        ensure the game startedwith the selected song.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Difficulty Controller</h4>

                    <p>
                        The Difficulty Controller handled the difficulty selector screen. This was also very similar to the Menu Controller and Select Controller. The main difference 
                        was that it prompted the user with a bunch of images along with a yes or no question. If the player selected yes, there would be an animation playing in the background 
                        while the game was in progress, which was the harder difficulty. If the player selected no, there would be no animation.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Game Controller</h4>

                    <p>
                        The Game Controller handled updating the main game screen. This controller was the heart of our project, since it contained the code for the actual game, 
                        and thus it was the longest file with the most logic. This controller can be broken up into two sections: game setup and gameplay.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Game Setup</h5>

                    <p>
                        Parse the song (explain JSON structure), create the stationary/pressed arrows (createArrows function), start music, start timer, initialize score and other display info, initialize
                        background based on the difficulty, determine how long the game will continue for
                    </p>

                    <h5>Gameplay</h5>

                    <p>
                        -Based on user input from the Input Controller, check if the user pressed the correct arrow at the right time
                            -checkPlayerInput: 3 possibilities, leniency
                        -Update score and other statistics
                        -Stop the game after the song finishes (give a few second cooldown before exiting the game screen)
                    </p>
